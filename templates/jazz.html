<h3>Herbie Hancock - Cantaloupe Island</h3>
<p>Cantaloupe Island is a Jazz standard that was recorded by Herbie Hancock in 1964.
    It was within his album Empyrean Isles, when Herbie Hancock was still part of the Miles Davis quintet.
    Hancock was on piano, Freddie Hubbard on cornet, Ron carter on Bass, and Tony Williams on drums.
    Be sure to give this classic Jazz standard a listen as it brings you through the funky and cool rhythms
    of Herbie Hancock's genius.</p>

<h3>Roy Hargrove - Strasbourg St. Denis</h3>
<p>Does jazz count as classy music? I feel like everything that was formally popular is considered classy.
I'm sure jazz wasn't considered classy back in the day. I watched a movie called swing kids where kids
protest hitler by listening and dancing to jazz. Anything that kids like, will not be considered classy.</p>

<h3>Charlie Parker - Confirmation</h3>
<p>Honestly, I feel like anything that can be played in front of an audience while the audience is sitting and not moshing is classy.
Like low energy but still enjoyable. I know this music is top tier, but to be honest, it sounds like the background music to a
growing up montage from the secret life of Pets. Groovy but still backgrounds music. Can't capture my full attention. But maybe
my generation has actually screwed attention spans, so I guess I'm not the boss of groovy or not music.</p>

<h3>Miles Davis - So What</h3>
<p>In the past songs, I felt that Jazz was an aquired taste that I hadn't yet aquired. And you know what?
    I still haven't. But I can still appreciate good music, like everyone. Maybe we as humans are desined to only truly
    vibe to the music we hear as kids.
    This song is groovy af like actually. I listened to it an the groove goes hard as heck. The little Br Br Br literally incredible.
This dude probably had to stand up to hella racists at the time too. Mad Respect.</p>
