<h3>Immigrant song - Led Zeppelin</h3>
<p>The Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin was released on October 5, 1970 with the album "Led Zeppelin III".
    The band members of Led Zeppelin are Jimmy Page, the guitarist, Robert Plant, the vocalist, John Bonham, the drummer, and John Paul Jones, the bassist.
    A large part of the lyrics allude to Norse Mythology and Plant's vocals represent war and Valhalla,
    a hall in Asgard that is ruled by Odin. This is a classic song that anyone should listen to as it is a great representation
    of Led Zeppelin, the progenitors of heavy metal and album-oriented rock.</p>

<h3>Comfortably Numb - Pink Floyd</h3>
<p>Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd is another classic song that was released in 1980 with their album "The Wall".
    The band members of Pink Floyd consist of David Gilmour, the guitarist and co-vocalist,
    Roger Waters, the bassist and vocalist, Nick Mason, the drummer, and Richard Wright, the keyboardist.
    Comfortably Numb is much more calm and mellow than anything by Led Zeppelin, and it is a song about loneliness.
    You should listen to this song as well because it is very different than that of Led Zeppelin's, but it can show you another side of rock music.</p>
